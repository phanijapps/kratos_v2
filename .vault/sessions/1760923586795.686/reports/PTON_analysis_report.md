1. **Options-specific data provider** (CBOE, OCC, or specialized options platforms)
2. **Weekly expiration focus**: Options expiring within 7 days would typically be the weekly Friday expirations
3. **Key data points needed**:
   - Strike prices near current price ($7.50)
   - Bid/ask spreads for calls and puts
   - Open interest levels
   - Implied volatility percentages
   - Volume and Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega)

- **Directional Bias**: Currently uncertain, awaiting catalyst

## Recommendations for Options Trading
Given the current price of $7.50 and recent volatility:
1. **For short-term options (7-day expiration)**: Focus on strikes between $7.00 and $8.00
2. **Implied volatility likely elevated** due to recent price swings
3. **Consider straddle/strangle strategies** to capture potential breakout moves
4. **Monitor volume and open interest** for liquidity in specific strikes
